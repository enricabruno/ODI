# ODI
<p>ODI is an Ontology of _Il castello dei destini incrociati_ written by Italo Calvino.</p>
BACODI is a Knowledge Base modelled on ODi Ontology and stores iconographical and textual elements of Calvino's work in their structural and narrative dimension.
This project aims to study the narrative use of tarot cards and their relationships in the stories of the work. 
It was realised as a master's thesis at the university of Bologna in Italian Studies, European Literary Cultures, Linguistics (https://corsi.unibo.it/magistrale/ItalianisticaCultureLetterarieLinguistica) under the supervision of Professor F. Tomasi (https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/francesca.tomasi) and Dr V. Pasqual (https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/valentina.pasqual2).
