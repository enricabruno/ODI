# ODI
<p>ODI is an Ontology of <i>Il castello dei destini incrociati</i> written by Italo Calvino.</p>
<p>BACODI is a Knowledge Base modelled on ODI Ontology and stores iconographical and textual elements of Calvino's work in their structural and narrative dimension.</p>
<p>This project aims to study the narrative use of tarot cards and their relationships in the stories of the work. 
It was realised as a master's thesis at the University of Bologna in Italian Studies, European Literary Cultures, Linguistics (https://corsi.unibo.it/magistrale/ItalianisticaCultureLetterarieLinguistica) under the supervision of Professor F. Tomasi (https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/francesca.tomasi) and Dr V. Pasqual (https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/valentina.pasqual2).</p>
